# LinkedIn-Scraper
This program scrapes job categories from CareerGuide and then scrapes jobs from linkedin under that category. Also add the final results to postgredSQL database.

Its an automatic scraper BUT you can manually search for perticular jobs and also set limits to how many results you will get.


NOTES:-

-Enter Server Details and Login Details before hand.

-This program is intensionally slowed down using time library due to linked bot sniping the my id multiple times.(WARNING DO NOT USE PERSONAL ID)

-Though unlikely to happen, If for some reason program doesn't work one time, just restart it multiple times as a lot of random stuff pops up on linked constantly.
